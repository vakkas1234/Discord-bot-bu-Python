# Discord-bot-but-Python
Hi friends, I made a Discord Bot, but that was done from Python.
# Setup
You need to install the project zip. Then you can open the file in Visual Studio Code or any compiler.
After that, you will see codes. But You have to have a Discord Bot token.
You can get the Discord Bot Token from the Discord Developer Portal.
That's All Thanks for reading.
